Installing and configuring Mosquitto
====================================

Since the installation depends on both your hardware and your operating system, you should research them specifically for your situation. 

Mosquitto is usually included in the repositories of the individual Linux distributions, but if you want to install a more up-to-date version, you should install directly from https://mosquitto.org/. The corresponding instructions are available there online.

Additionally it is helpful to install the package mosquitto-clients to test the default configuration.

Here are some helpful links to begin with:

* http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/install-mosquitto-linux/
* https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-the-mosquitto-mqtt-messaging-broker-on-debian-8

In general, test whether the Mosquitto service itself is running (for example: sudo service mosquitto status). With the default installation the MQTT broker is running on port 1883. You can also test whether the MQTT broker is running with 

    netstat â€“at

Another test, that it is working is to open two terminals. In terminal one subscribe to a test-topic, in terminal two publish a message to the test-topic. This message should be visible in terminal one after publication.

Enter in terminal one:

    mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "testtopic" -v

Enter in terminal two:

    mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "testtopic" -m "Testing"


## Add user and password protection

By default, Mosquitto will allow anonymous connections, i.e. connections where no username/password is provided. If you want to add user and password protection use the "mosquitto_passwd" command to create a password file.

    mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd username

Then add the path to your password file in mosquitto.conf:

    password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd

 In addition to the password_file entry, you also need to edit:

    allow_anonymous false


## Individualize Mosquitto

The default mosquitto.conf file is located in the /etc/mosquitto/ folder. Based on this configuration file you can individualize your installation.

Here are some links to Mosquitto configuration tutorials:

* https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-setup-a-mosquitto-mqtt-server-and-receive-data-from-owntracks

Meaningful items to configure are:

    listener 8883 <yourIP>
    persistence true
    persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/
    persistence_file mosquitto.db
    log_dest syslog
    log_dest stdout
    log_dest topic
    log_type error
    log_type warning
    log_type notice
    log_type information
    connection_messages true
    log_timestamp true
    allow_anonymous false
    password_file /etc/mosquitto/pwfile


Finally be sure to run:

    /sbin/ldconfig


Hints
=====

## Time stamp format

If you microcontroller sends data via Mosquitto to InfluxDB please take note that the timestamp format of InfluxDB is rather special.

Everything in InfluxDB is stored and reported in UTC. By default, timestamps are returned in RFC3339 UTC and have nanosecond precision. Grafana, in contrast to InfluxDB, seems to work with [ms] for the timestamp.


## Client ID 

Every client which connects to Mosquitto should have an individual ID! Otherwise connections will be terminated if there is still an open connection on the server.
